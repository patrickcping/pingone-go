### NewPopulationsEmbedded

`func NewPopulationsEmbedded() *PopulationsEmbedded`

NewPopulationsEmbedded instantiates a new PopulationsEmbedded object
This constructor will assign default values to properties that have it defined,
and makes sure properties required by API are set, but the set of arguments
will change when the set of required properties is changed

### NewPopulationsEmbeddedWithDefaults

`func NewPopulationsEmbeddedWithDefaults() *PopulationsEmbedded`

NewPopulationsEmbeddedWithDefaults instantiates a new PopulationsEmbedded object
This constructor will only assign default values to properties that have it defined,
but it doesn't guarantee that properties required by API are set

### GetPopulations

`func (o *PopulationsEmbedded) GetPopulations() []Population`

GetPopulations returns the Populations field if non-nil, zero value otherwise.

### GetPopulationsOk

`func (o *PopulationsEmbedded) GetPopulationsOk() (*[]Population, bool)`

GetPopulationsOk returns a tuple with the Populations field if it's non-nil, zero value otherwise
and a boolean to check if the value has been set.

### SetPopulations

`func (o *PopulationsEmbedded) SetPopulations(v []Population)`

SetPopulations sets Populations field to given value.

### HasPopulations

`func (o *PopulationsEmbedded) HasPopulations() bool`
