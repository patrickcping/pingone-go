## Methods

### NewRiskPolicySetConditionAggregatedWeights

`func NewRiskPolicySetConditionAggregatedWeights(value string, weight int32, ) *RiskPolicySetConditionAggregatedWeights`

NewRiskPolicySetConditionAggregatedWeights instantiates a new RiskPolicySetConditionAggregatedWeights object
This constructor will assign default values to properties that have it defined,
and makes sure properties required by API are set, but the set of arguments
will change when the set of required properties is changed

### NewRiskPolicySetConditionAggregatedWeightsWithDefaults

`func NewRiskPolicySetConditionAggregatedWeightsWithDefaults() *RiskPolicySetConditionAggregatedWeights`

NewRiskPolicySetConditionAggregatedWeightsWithDefaults instantiates a new RiskPolicySetConditionAggregatedWeights object
This constructor will only assign default values to properties that have it defined,
but it doesn't guarantee that properties required by API are set

### GetValue

`func (o *RiskPolicySetConditionAggregatedWeights) GetValue() string`

GetValue returns the Value field if non-nil, zero value otherwise.

### GetValueOk

`func (o *RiskPolicySetConditionAggregatedWeights) GetValueOk() (*string, bool)`

GetValueOk returns a tuple with the Value field if it's non-nil, zero value otherwise
and a boolean to check if the value has been set.

### SetValue

`func (o *RiskPolicySetConditionAggregatedWeights) SetValue(v string)`

SetValue sets Value field to given value.


### GetWeight

`func (o *RiskPolicySetConditionAggregatedWeights) GetWeight() int32`

GetWeight returns the Weight field if non-nil, zero value otherwise.

### GetWeightOk

`func (o *RiskPolicySetConditionAggregatedWeights) GetWeightOk() (*int32, bool)`

GetWeightOk returns a tuple with the Weight field if it's non-nil, zero value otherwise
and a boolean to check if the value has been set.

### SetWeight

`func (o *RiskPolicySetConditionAggregatedWeights) SetWeight(v int32)`

SetWeight sets Weight field to given value.
